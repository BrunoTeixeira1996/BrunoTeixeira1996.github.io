## First recon

### Larapios Group Access


*"Larapios Group states that they access to our core infrastructure!
They claim that our security is lacking and have credentials to access our systems.
Quickly, grab the access and gain access to one of the internal machines!"*

<br>

- First thing I did was to find all the up hosts and then find more info about those and for that I used nmap

```bash
$ nmap -sn 192.168.111.0/24

Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.26
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.30
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.31
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.34
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.36
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.41
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.42

$  nmap -O 192.168.111.0/24

```

- Since this returned so much info I grouped everything by Windows and Linux machines by using the TTL when pinging and got the following

```
192.168.111.26:Windows
192.168.111.30:Windows
192.168.111.31:Linux
192.168.111.34:Linux
192.168.111.36:Windows
192.168.111.41:Windows
192.168.111.42:Windows
```

- Grabing the first machine (Windows) I wanted to enumerate more and since this is most likely using Windows AD why not enumerate for LDAP? After enumerating I got the respective domain `bajordas.local` and the DC

```bash
$ sudo nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" 192.168.111.26
ldapServiceName: bajordas.local:win-dc01$@BAJORDAS.LOCAL
```

- Next thing I did was to enumerate all Windows machines for RDP since its a common service used by Windows and doing this got a lot more info like machine names and some juicy info

```
192.168.111.26
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: WIN-DC01
|   DNS_Computer_Name: WIN-DC01.bajordas.local

192.168.111.30
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-SHARE01
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-SHARE01.bajordas.local

192.168.111.36
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: WIN-MGMT
|   DNS_Computer_Name: WIN-MGMT.bajordas.local

192.168.111.41
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN6
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN6.bajordas.local

192.168.111.42
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN7
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN7.bajordas.local
```

- Next, but still in the enumeration process I enumerated smb and found powershell scripts on `.30` machine

```bash
$ sudo nmap --script smb-enum-domains.nse,smb-enum-groups.nse,smb-enum-processes.nse,smb-enum-services.nse,smb-enum-sessions.nse,smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse -p445 192.168.111.30

users1.ps1
provisionUsers.ps1
```

- provisionUsers.ps1 had creds for sedalfino

```ps
net user sedalfino.freitas Summer2022 /add
```

- users1.ps1 was a golden mine with more user creds

```ps
#new joiners
net user rogerio.marques Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rute.rodrigues Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rita.munoiz Summer2022 /add /domain
net user renato.recesso Summer2022 /add /domain
net user carolina.azevedo Summer2022 /add /domain
net user casemiro.silva Summer2022 /add /domain
net user jose.borges Summer2022 /add /domain
net user stefan.silva Summer2022 /add /domain
net user mary.christmas Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rodgers.john Summer2022 /add /domain
```


- Knowing this I tried to authenticate anonymously on `.30` to check those shares

```bash
$ smbclient --no-pass -L //192.168.111.30/

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	Admins$         Disk
	Backups         Disk
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	Scripts         Disk
	Users           Disk
```

- After this I tried to the creds I've found but only `sedalfino.freitas` were working but still I got the same privileges as anonymous

```bash
$ smbmap -u 'sedalfino.freitas' -p 'Summer2022' -d 'bajordas' -H 192.168.111.26
```

- After some minutes (hours?) I decided to use xfreerdp and connect to any machine and I was able to do that on `.41` but using remmina with `sedalfino.freitas:Summer2022` and `BAJORDAS.LOCAL` creds


```
flag{oneSmallFootInTheEnterprise}
```

## Second recon

### Spread Your Hacks

*"You got in? Noice!"*
*"I heard they got a special machine for "Important People", but they are not very security-focused and their automation is faulty. Can you access it?"*

<br>

- I already enumed a lot for the Windows machines so now I tried to jump to some Linux ones and used `enum4linux` for that

- enum4linux gave me some creds

```bash
$ enum4linux -u "sedalfino.freitas" -p "Summer2022" -U 192.168.111.26`

index: 0x109a RID: 0x454 acb: 0x00000210 Account: big.boss Name: big boss Desc: Password: Money$$$ , make all managers the same password so I have access
```

- Using `big.boss:Money$$$` I was able to rdp to `192.168.111.41` and `192.168.42`

- On `192.168.111.42` I've found the flag 

```
flag{slowMovingRabbit}
```

## Windows

### Big Dollar Spender


*"You in? Nice! Can you pwn it? Maybe..."*

*"They installed some shady service and hammered things down to make it work. Maybe it can be exploited in your favour"*

<br>

- While doing enumeration and research on `192.168.111.42` i noticed a strange file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186279966-faba5a17-86f1-4f63-8963-247f750c18fc.png)

- winPEAS did a great job identifing the strange file permissions

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280079-4c18c89c-ef06-412b-9773-84af9b6abbff.png)

- After some hours of digging google and trying to understand how could I exploit this, I noticed that I could execute the file

- Everytime I tried executing the file I had an error

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280294-3cdf01b3-8e15-4300-92df-01b68d8120e2.png)

- Then I created a malicious .bat file that creates an user and gives permissions to that user but that didn't work either

- Next thing was to use [PowerUp](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/powerup)

- With PowerUp executed I noticed a couple stuff i could do like abusing the service `bajordas-svc` with PowerUp

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280695-ce41f69b-a109-4bdc-b58c-1c10be302f2c.png)

- Abused the `bajordas-svc` and got a new user with Admin privileges

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280851-bcfbd706-5081-4571-b07e-10dae5b5393b.png)

- To sign-in as this user I used rdp and got the flag inside `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`

```
flag{GameOn!}
```
